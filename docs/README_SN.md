```
* I am not responsible for any damage done to your device. Use at your own risk.
* Please do some research if you concerns about features included in this EFI.
* Before continuing, you are choosing to make these modifications yourself
* if any thing goes wrong, it is your responsible for the damage that happen next.
```

## Important note
### [!] Don't forget to update your kexts to Sonoma specific version if avaliable.

### From now you need to generate your own SMBIOS to signin with Apple ID
Use CorpNewt's [GENSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate platforminfo using **MacBookPro15,2** as an SMBIOS for Sonoma. Head to [Dortania's haswell platforminfo guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/haswell.html#platforminfo) for in-depth guide.

### Wlan Related kext
If you have difference **Wlan card** other than Intel ([OpenIntelWireless](https://openintelwireless.github.io/) kexts were used for both WiFi and Bluetooth)
#### **removes/excludes:**
* AirportItlwm.kext
* BlueToolFixup.kext

* IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext

from **EFI/OC/Kexts** folder and **config.plist** then replace with one that work for your card.
